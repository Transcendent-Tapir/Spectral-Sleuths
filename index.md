Spectral Sleuths: A Supernatural investigation game using the Distortion Dice system

In Spectral Sleuths, the players take on the role of investigators. Mostly ordinary humans who, for some reason or another, are driven to look into the strange and unexplainable, and often find themselves in over their heads because of it. Investigators will follow up on rumors and unexplainable stories to look for the truth. Hopefully finding it, and proof of the supernatural, if it doesn't kill them first.

While investigators may have some abilities out of the norm, such as the ability to sense magic, commune with spirits, or ward a room, they are still mortal, and their powers would be very limited.

Inspirations include X-files, Old Gods of Appalachia, SCP, Liminal Horror, Monster of the Week, The Magnus Archives, Phasmophobia, Living for the Dead, and The Dead Files

The reason for investigation could be a number of things, such as

- TV/web show about the supernatural
- a curiosities shop looking to collect rare items
- an institute dedicated to the study of the unexplainable
- nomadic bounty hunters jumping from job to job
- a private investigator & friends
- investigative journalism
- A mystery club in a high school
- trying to prove yourself to a forum of paranormal enthusiasts

Set both of your negative aspects to d6

### Assets

Pick one signature asset that starts at a d8.
This asset is always the same, and should be significant to your character.

A signature asset should be something like
- my trusty shotgun
- dusty old book of the arcane
- My mother's cleansing crystals
- customized DSLR camera with infrared detection 

you also carry 3 mundane items rated at a d6. these items can be defined during play and can change every investigation

Some mundane items you might bring

- salt
- rope
- holy water
- wooden stakes
- silver knife
- dried herbs
- lighter fluid
- emf reader
- night vision camera
- chalk

### Harm

Harm can only be reduced through a specific action, or through rest. A short rest is a few minutes and can reduce a harm track by one. A long rest is a full night and can reduce each harm track by one. You can take an action appropriate for each harm track to try and reduce it, but failure means increasing it.

If Harm is raised above a d12, that character is incapacitated and takes on or raises a negative aspect. An incapacitated character is retired if they are not removed from that situation. An incapacitated character cannot act on their own. If a negative aspect would be raised above a d12 that character is automatically retired and cannot be saved.

### Tension Die

this is a die that represents the constant tension and risk involved in an investigation. There are two version of the Tension Die, a rising Tension Die, and a Static Tension Die. The static Tension Die is constant and represents the constant supernatural threat of an investigation. Like all other dice, it can be anywhere from a d4 to a d12. Unlike other dice, it cannot be stepped down.

The rising Tension die starts at a d4 or d6 and represents a potentially growing threat. As the players investigate, background forces are also going to work towards their goals, and when those goals are achieved, the tension die grows. If those goals are thwarted, the tension die shrinks. If it raises above a d12, the ultimate goal of the antagonists is reached, the players, and possible the entire world, lose. If it's lowered below a d4, the antagonists are defeated, and their threat is gone.

### Investigations

Sleuths take on investigations based on rumors they've heard or because someone has requested them. Their goal is generally to get to the bottom of what is going on, and potentially find a solution. 

Investigations should start with something small that could be hard to explain. Things like unexplainable lights or noises, strange animal behavior, feelings of unease, lost time, things suspiciously going missing. As the sleuths investigate, things will become increasingly complex and dangerous. Investigations will involve looking into the history of an area, questioning witnesses, and using equipment to detect, record, and put a stop to unusual events. 

Surviving and going up against supernatural forces often involve finding your way out of traps, withstanding otherworldly forces, and even using brute force.
